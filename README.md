## 🚀 About Me
I'm a Graphic Designer and Developer with a passion for creating. I have experience in a variety of areas including:

- 🎨 **Graphic Design**
- 🚇 **MTA**
- 🎮 **FiveM**
- 🌐 **Website Creation**
- 💬 **Discord Server Creation**

I love the process of creating and improving designs and code to make user experiences more enjoyable. I'm always learning and looking for new challenges!

## 🛠 Skills
- **Graphic Design:** I have a keen eye for design and a strong understanding of design principles. I can create visually appealing graphics for a variety of mediums.
- **MTA & FiveM:** I have experience working with Multi Theft Auto (MTA) and FiveM, creating unique and engaging experiences for players.
- **Website Creation:** I can build responsive and user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Discord Server Creation:** I can set up and manage Discord servers, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable experience for all members.

## 🎯 Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- **StarGaming MTA:** A custom RolePlay gamemode for Multi Theft Auto that prevents cheaters and has a beautiful ui matched to the 2024 standarts.
- **OwlGamingPlus MTA:** A RolePlay gamemode for Multi Theft Auto based on OwlGaming with a plan to make a better open-source starting roleplay gamemode.
- **Latvian MTA:** I have worked on 10+ more projects for Multi Theft Auto, but i won't list them here, they don't exist anymore.

## 🎯 Future Projects
Here are some of my future projects:

- **StarGaming FiveM:** A RolePlay Latvian server on QB-Core framework.
- **OwlGamingPlus MTA:** Maybe one day i will finish this old gamemode.
